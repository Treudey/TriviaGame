# Ancient History Trivia

A trivia game that asks you nine question to test your Classical Civilizations knowledge!

#### Here's how the app works:

* One question is shown at a time until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option is shown. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  * If the player runs out of time, the player is told that time's up and the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question is shown.
  * If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player is told they selected the wrong option and the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question   is shown.

* On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page) are displayed.
